                <h2>🚦 The Ever-Flowing City Life</h2>
                <p>
                    City life is often associated with rush, noise, and crowds, but when observed carefully,
                    it reveals unique beauty in every corner. Streets passed by without notice during daily routines,
                    details of old buildings, and lights reflecting on windows at sunset quietly tell the city’s story.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The photographs on this page aim to capture moments that often go unnoticed while living in the city.
                    A person sitting alone in a café, rain-soaked pavements, small shops in side streets,
                    and brief pauses within the crowd are all reflected in these frames.
                </p>

                <p>
                    City life is not only about speed and chaos; it is also an opportunity for discovery,
                    observation, and collecting memories. Sometimes, stopping for a moment and noticing these small
                    details within the crowd makes the city more meaningful.

                            The modern architecture of Ataşehir creates a stunning view at sunset,
                            with light reflecting off the glass surfaces of the buildings.

                        <h3>🚶‍♂️ The City Crowd</h3>
                        <p>
                            This crowd, which I encounter every day near my home, reflects the dynamic nature of the city.
                            The constant rush of people reminds us that life is always in motion.
