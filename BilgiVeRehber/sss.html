                    <h3 class="faq-question">🥾 How much experience is needed to start hiking?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        You can start with no experience at all! I recommend beginning with easy
                        and short trails. For your first hikes, going with an experienced person
                        is safer. Over time, you will build endurance and try more challenging routes.

                    <h3 class="faq-question">🎒 What equipment should I definitely bring?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        Basic equipment includes: comfortable hiking shoes, water (at least 2 liters),
                        food, a first aid kit, map/GPS, flashlight, rain jacket, extra clothing,
                        sunscreen, and a hat. This list may vary depending on the season and route.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">⛰️ Which season is best for hiking?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        Spring and autumn are the most ideal seasons. The temperature is pleasant,
                        nature is vibrant, and conditions are perfect for hiking. In summer, start
                        early in the morning; in winter, be cautious due to snow and ice.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">🗺️ How should I choose a route?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        Choose a route suitable for your physical condition. For beginners,
                        2–3 hour easy trails are ideal. Read online reviews, study the map,
                        and if possible, get advice from someone who has completed the route before.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">🏕️ Do I need permission to camp?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        In national parks and protected areas, permission is usually required.
                        Research the regulations of the area beforehand. In some regions,
                        camping is allowed only in designated zones.
                    </p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">🐻 What should I do if I encounter wild animals?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        Stay calm and do not panic. Slowly back away without making eye contact.
                        Never run or feed the animal. Making noise while hiking can help
                        alert animals in advance.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">💧 Are natural water sources safe to drink?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        Drinking directly from streams or springs can be risky.
                        Bring enough water with you or use water purification tablets.
                        If you are unsure, do not drink it.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">📱 What if there is no phone signal?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        Inform someone about your plan before leaving. Download offline maps.
                        In emergencies, you can use a whistle or mirror for signaling.
                        If lost, stay in one place and wait for rescue teams.

                    <h3 class="faq-question">🌡️ How can I protect myself in cold weather?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        Dress in layers (base layer, mid layer, outer layer). Protect your head,
                        hands, and feet. Change wet clothes immediately. Bring a thermos with
                        hot drinks and maintain regular energy intake.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">🚑 Is first aid knowledge necessary?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        Basic first aid knowledge is very important. You should be able to handle
                        sprains, cuts, and burns. I strongly recommend taking a first aid course.
                        Always carry a first aid kit with you.

                    These answers provide general information. Every hike is different and
                    requires preparation based on its specific conditions. If in doubt,
                    contact an experienced guide or a mountaineering club.
