                <h2 class="category-title">⛰️ Hiking and Nature</h2>
                <p>
                    The photographs on this page were taken during my hiking trips and camping experiences.
                    I started my hike early in the morning while the air was still cool.
                    As I walked along forest trails, the silence and fresh air allowed me to completely
                    escape the chaos of city life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the paths continued, the terrain began to change; in some areas, the roads were
                    covered with snow, while in others, the trees were surrounded by fog.
                    These changing natural conditions made the hike both more challenging and more impressive.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The landscape photos I took near the summit felt like a reward for all the exhaustion.
                    The forests stretching below and the distant horizon disappearing into the distance
                    once again reminded me how strong the connection with nature can be.
                    This hike was not only a physical activity for me, but also a mental renewal experience.
